<p>The University of Texas at Austin seeks an Executive Director of the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. The Center is an Organized Research Unit (ORU) of the university and is jointly administered by the School of Architecture and the College of Natural Sciences. The deans and faculty are looking for a dynamic individual to provide visionary leadership for the Wildflower Center.</p>

<p>Founded in 1982 by Lady Bird Johnson, the Center’s vision and mission are to create a world enriched and supported through our interactions with the land and to conserve, restore, and create healthy landscapes using extensive knowledge of native plants and native ecosystems. The Center is a nationally acclaimed research center and botanic garden that promotes Mrs. Johnson’s legacy by developing and showcasing new approaches to landscape conservation, restoration, and sustainable practices. It is located on 279 acres in Austin, Texas, has over 11,000 members, and is visited by over 140,000 people annually. There are 60 employees, an Advisory Council of 45, and over 850 volunteers. The Center is self-supporting, with a $10.5 million endowment and $6 million annual operating budget that comes from visitor-related revenues and fundraising. It has expanded its national reach through a range of activities, which include the EcoSystems Design Group, the Sustainable Sites Initiative, a vibrant Education Program, Plant Conservation Program, and the web-based Native Plant Information Network.</p>

<p>The Executive Director should be committed to providing leadership for the continued development of nationally recognized programs of instruction, research, and public service, and for guiding the Wildflower Center in its fundraising efforts and interactions with external constituents. The Executive Director is expected to play a major role in the generation of income for the Center.</p>

<p>The Executive Director must have a national or international reputation based on research, scholarship, and/or creative practice with experience in natural resources conservation, landscape architecture, planning, ecology, environmental sciences, horticulture, botany or a related field. Administrative excellence demonstrating leadership, personnel management skills, and expertise in communicating in culturally diverse environments is required, as is experience securing financial support for research, capital projects, and programs. An advanced degree is required.</p>
