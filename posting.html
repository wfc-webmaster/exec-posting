<span style="text-align:center;"><h3>Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center<br />
Executive Director</h3></span>

<p>The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The University of Texas at Austin seeks a dynamic, accomplished Executive Director committed to conserving native plants and promoting their use to create healthy landscapes.</p>

<p>"My hope for what lies ahead in the field of landscape design - our own and that of the professionals - is not a revolution against the use of non-natives, but a resolution to educate ourselves about what has worked for Mother Nature through the ebb and flow of time and to put that knowledge to work in the planned landscapes that are everywhere a part of our lives," said Mrs. Johnson. "I'm optimistic that the world of native plants will not only survive, but will thrive for environmental and economic reasons, and for reasons of the heart. Beauty in nature nourishes us and brings joy to the human spirit, it also is one of the deep needs of people everywhere."</p>

<h3>About the Center</h3>

<p>The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center is a nationally acclaimed research center and botanic garden that showcases and promotes the use of native plants. Founded in 1982 by Lady Bird Johnson, the Center’s vision and mission is to create a world enriched and supported through our interactions with the land and to conserve, restore and create healthy landscapes using our extensive knowledge of native plants and native ecosystems.</p>

<p>The Center is located on 279 acres in Southwest Austin in the Edward’s Plateau ecoregion. It has approximately 11,000 members, 60 employees, and 850 volunteers and is visited by more than 100,000 people annually. A 45-member advisory council oversees the Center’s activities.</p>

<p>Though part of UT Austin, the Center is self-supporting, with a $10.5 million endowment and $5.7 million annual operating budget that comes from visitor-related revenues and fundraising. It has expanded its national reach through a range of activities, which include the research and consulting of its Ecosystem Design Group, the Sustainable Sites Initiative, a vibrant Education Program, the Plant Conservation Program, and the web-based North American native plant database.</p>

<p>The Center is currently jointly administered by the School of Architecture and the College of Natural Sciences.</p>
